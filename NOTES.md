## Notes

* Hardware acceleration makes a positive difference (with `<img>`) on Chrome
* See how at 1M `<img>`, we're bottle-necked by the CPU.

## Comparisons

* Performance of Rendering vs Updating vs Transforming

### `<img>`
* With vs without hardware acceleration
* Unique urls vs common urls
* PNGs vs GIFs

## TODO

* Research gif controls
* Video element
* Hot-swap with static png
